# ArtooVirtualJoystick
Various Artoo hacks by William Peale, Josh Jacobs, and Ian McNanie.

Running "python pixjoy.py" will make artoo a virtual joystick if you're on its network. Keep killing it.


May have to:
- Run with Sudo
- Run "sudo modprobe uinput"

Tricks
- Camera click + A + Pause keeps artoo from turning off
